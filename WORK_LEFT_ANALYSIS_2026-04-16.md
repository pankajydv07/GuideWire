# Zylo — Work Left Analysis (Updated)

Date: 2026-04-16  
Baseline compared: provided `work-left.md` content (Phase 3 gap list) vs current `main` code in this repository.

---

## Executive Summary

The provided gap report is **materially outdated**.  
Several Phase 3 items previously marked missing are now implemented, including:
- AQI trigger/data integration
- Isolation Forest + collusion scoring integration
- rider/admin predictive intelligence surfaces
- admin fraud queue and payout analytics
- knowledge-graph snapshot/propagation API and Neo4j service wiring
- adaptive trigger-threshold calibration

Estimated status now:

| Phase | Status | Completion (updated estimate) |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 — Foundation | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Phase 2 — Automation & Protection | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Phase 3 — Scale & Optimise | 🟡 Partial | ~75–85% |

## What Changed Since the Provided Work-Left Snapshot

### Now Implemented (previously listed as missing)

1. **G1 AQI/GRAP evaluator** is implemented
   - `backend/trigger_service/service.py` includes `AQI_GRAP_THRESHOLD = 300` and `eval_aqi()`.
2. **G11 OWM Air Pollution integration** is implemented
   - `backend/data_collectors/weather_client.py` calls `/data/2.5/air_pollution` and maps OWM AQI to proxy Indian AQI.
3. **AQI scenario wiring is implemented**
   - `backend/data_collectors/platform_simulator.py` has `ScenarioKey.AQI_GRAP`.
   - `backend/trigger_service/router.py` allows `"aqi_grap"` injection type.
4. **Isolation Forest-based anomaly signal is integrated**
   - Training artifact path and loader in `backend/ml/serve.py`.
   - Fraud scoring consumes anomaly score in `backend/claims_service/fraud.py`.
   - Training script exists: `backend/ml/training/train_isolation_forest.py`.
5. **Collusion spike detection exists (SQL-based)**
   - `backend/claims_service/fraud.py` has `detect_collusion()` and adds collusion points.
6. **Rider predictive intelligence is implemented**
   - `GET /riders/me/intelligence` in `backend/rider_service/router.py`.
   - Mobile dashboard surfaces next-week forecast + forward alerts in `mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.
7. **Admin predictive/fraud/payout analytics are implemented**
   - Endpoints in `backend/admin_service/router.py`: `/analytics/predictive`, `/claims/fraud-alerts`, `/analytics/payouts`.
   - UI pages exist: `admin/src/app/predictive/page.tsx`, `admin/src/app/fraud-alerts/page.tsx`, `admin/src/app/payout-analytics/page.tsx`.
8. **Self-calibrating threshold API is implemented**
   - Trigger thresholds are dynamically calibrated in `backend/trigger_service/service.py`.
   - Exposed for admin in `/analytics/thresholds`.
9. **Knowledge graph snapshot + propagation logic is implemented**
   - Graph snapshot and propagation edges in `backend/knowledge_graph/service.py`.
   - Exposed via `GET /admin/graph/knowledge`.
10. **Neo4j service is now present in stack config**
   - `docker-compose.yml` includes a `neo4j` service.

## Prioritized Remaining Backlog

### High Priority
1. Add **real payment rail simulation depth**: Razorpay/Stripe sandbox + webhook reconciliation.
2. Add **FCM payout notifications** on successful payout.
3. Add **geo-velocity impossibility** and stronger anti-spoofing checks into fraud scoring.
4. Evolve **Knowledge Graph v0** from relational snapshot to full **Neo4j-backed ingestion + query paths**.
5. Implement **graph-grade collusion/ring detection** over the graph layer.

### Medium Priority
6. Add **advanced fraud models** (behavioural autoencoder and counterfactual estimator) for stronger decision support.
7. Improve temporal forecasting from heuristic utilities to **sequence-learning models** (TCN/Transformer).

### Lower Priority
8. Strengthen graph semantics (road/store/event typed nodes + richer propagation causality).
9. Produce and include **final demo package artifacts** (video + pitch deck).

## Validation Notes (current environment)

- Baseline checks were attempted before documentation changes.
- In this environment, local tooling dependencies are currently missing:
  - `backend`: `python -m pytest -q tests` failed because `pytest` is not installed.
  - `admin`: `npm run lint` failed because `eslint` is not installed.
  - `admin`: `npm run build` failed because `next` is not installed.
- To run these checks locally after dependency setup:
  - `backend`: install dependencies (project-standard Python setup) and rerun `python -m pytest -q tests`.
  - `admin`: run `npm install`, then rerun `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.
